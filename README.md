Depending on the quality of the original document, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can produce a range of errors â€“ from erroneous letters to additional and spurious blank spaces. This issue risks to compromise the effectiveness of the analysis tasks in support to the study of texts. Furthermore, the presence of multiple errors of different type in a certain text segment can introduce so much noise that the overall digitization process becomes useless.

The goal of this project is to explore machine learning techniques, in particular sequence to sequence learning, to develop a text correction tool. 

Typically, there are two main errors:

wrong characters in words: (this senlence contains and effor)

wrong segmentation: (th is sentencecont ains an error)

# Dataset
I have used a dataset which consists of 2225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech) from 2004-2005.
